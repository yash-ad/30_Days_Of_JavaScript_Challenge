//2.What are the uses of promises in js?
//Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript.
//An asynchronous operation is one that does not complete immediately it takes time to finish.
//Promises allows to write code that can wait for an asynchronous operation to complete the task,
// without blocking the execution of the other code.


//Now promises has four states:-
//1.Pending state:- That means neither been fulfilled nor been rejected , its in the pending state
//2.Fulfilled state:-This state represents that promise has been fulfilled,means that async operations is completed.
